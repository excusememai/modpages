# modpages
Opens the mod pages for popular standard/basic minecraft mods for a fresh installation

------ What Does This App Do? ------

This app simply opens the download pages for a bunch of standard installation mods for Minecraft including iris, sodium and more. I find it helpful because it helps me remember what mods I need for a basic install it was basically made for me and my weird brain as a funny thing but if you find it helpful that's awesome! If you want me to add any mods dm me on my socials but I do want to keep the program with the basic/standard mods as possible
